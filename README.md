# Snippets
Snippets demonstrate Tabris.js features. They can be used as a starting point for integrating a feature in your app.

## Running a Snippet
Snippets can also be run stand-alone in the [Tabris.js developer app](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/developer-app). To start a server with the snippet, run:

```sh
$ npm start <snippet> # e.g. button.js
```

Then point the Tabris.js developer app to the provided URL.
